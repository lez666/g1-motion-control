    Extends IsaacLab's UsdFileCfg to add source prim path filtering capability,
    allowing loading of specific prims from USD files instead of the entire file.
    This is essential for the USD scene loader functionality.

    Parameters
    ----------
    source_path : str, optional
        The prim path within the USD file to load. Defaults to "/" (root).
        Example: "/Scene/Items/Apple" to load only the Apple prim.
    disable_instanceable : bool, optional
        Whether to disable instanceable flag before applying physics properties.
        Defaults to False. Set to True to avoid USD instancing conflicts.
